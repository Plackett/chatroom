# Simple C++ Chatrooms!

This program allows you to host or join little chatrooms with your friends!

## Compiling

There is a simple CMakeLists.txt file included, load this project into your favorite C++ IDE and load the CMake project to compile the chatrooms executable.

## Running

Simply put the executable on your machine and whatever other machines you want to host and open up a TCP port on the host machine. From there just open the chatroom and begin talking. :D
